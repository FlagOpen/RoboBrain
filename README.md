## üî• Overview
Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various multimodal contexts. However, their application in robotic scenarios, particularly for long-horizon manipulation tasks, reveals significant limitations. These limitations arise from the current MLLMs lacking three essential robotic brain capabilities: **(1) Planning Capability**, which involves decomposing complex manipulation instructions into manageable sub-tasks; **(2) Affordance Perception**, the ability to recognize and interpret the affordances of interactive objects; and **(3) Trajectory Prediction**, the foresight to anticipate the complete manipulation trajectory necessary for successful execution. To enhance the robotic brain's core capabilities from abstract to concrete, we introduce ShareRobot, a high-quality heterogeneous dataset that labels multi-dimensional information such as task planning, object affordance, and end-effector trajectory. ShareRobot's diversity and accuracy have been meticulously refined by three human annotators. Building on this dataset, we developed RoboBrain, an MLLM-based model that combines robotic and general multi-modal data, utilizes a multi-stage training strategy, and incorporates long videos and high-resolution images to improve its robotic manipulation capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboBrain achieves state-of-the-art performance across various robotic tasks, highlighting its potential to advance robotic brain capabilities.

## <a id="Inference">‚≠êÔ∏è Inference</a>

### 1. Usage for Planning Prediction

#### Option 1: HF inference

```python
from inference import SimpleInference

model_id = "BAAI/RoboBrain"
model = SimpleInference(model_id)

prompt = "Given the obiects in the image, if you are required to complete the task \"Put the apple in the basket\", what is your detailed plan? Write your plan and explain it in detail, using the following format: Step_1: xxx\nStep_2: xxx\n ...\nStep_n: xxx\n"

image = "./assets/demo/planning.png"

pred = model.inference(prompt, image, do_sample=True)
print(f"Prediction: {pred}")

''' 
Prediction: (as an example)
    Step_1: Move to the apple. Move towards the apple on the table.
    Step_2: Pick up the apple. Grab the apple and lift it off the table.
    Step_3: Move towards the basket. Move the apple towards the basket without dropping it.
    Step_4: Put the apple in the basket. Place the apple inside the basket, ensuring it is in a stable position.
'''

```

#### Option 2: VLLM inference
Install and launch VLLM
```bash
# Install vllm package
pip install vllm==0.6.6.post1

# Launch Robobrain with vllm
python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server --model BAAI/RoboBrain --served-model-name robobrain  --max_model_len 16384 --limit_mm_per_prompt image=8
```

Run python script as example:
```python
from openai import OpenAI
import base64

openai_api_key = "robobrain-123123" 
openai_api_base = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1"

prompt = "You are a robot using the joint control. The task is \"push the bicycle\". Please predict a possible affordance area of the end effector?"

image = "./assets/demo/affordance_2.jpg"

pred = model.inference(prompt, image, do_sample=False)
