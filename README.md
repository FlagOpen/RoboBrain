Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various multimodal contexts. However, their application in robotic scenarios, particularly for long-horizon manipulation tasks, reveals significant limitations. These limitations arise from the current MLLMs lacking three essential robotic brain capabilities: **(1) Planning Capability**, which involves decomposing complex manipulation instructions into manageable sub-tasks; **(2) Affordance Perception**, the ability to recognize and interpret the affordances of interactive objects; and **(3) Trajectory Prediction**, the foresight to anticipate the complete manipulation trajectory necessary for successful execution. To enhance the robotic brain's core capabilities from abstract to concrete, we introduce ShareRobot, a high-quality heterogeneous dataset that labels multi-dimensional information such as task planning, object affordance, and end-effector trajectory. ShareRobot's diversity and accuracy have been meticulously refined by three human annotators. Building on this dataset, we developed RoboBrain, an MLLM-based model that combines robotic and general multi-modal data, utilizes a multi-stage training strategy, and incorporates long videos and high-resolution images to improve its robotic manipulation capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboBrain achieves state-of-the-art performance across various robotic tasks, highlighting its potential to advance robotic brain capabilities.

```bash
python scripts/infer/convert_robobrain_to_hf.py --model_dir /path/to/original/checkpoint/ --dump_path /path/to/output/
```


## ü§ñ Inference

### Option 1: HF inference

#### Run python script as example:
```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoProcessor, AutoModelForPreTraining

model_id = "BAAI/RoboBrain"

print("Loading Checkpoint ...")
model = AutoModelForPreTraining.from_pretrained(
    model_id, 
    torch_dtype=torch.float16, 
    low_cpu_mem_usage=True, 
).to("cuda:0")

processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id)

# Define a chat history and use `apply_chat_template` to get correctly formatted prompt
# Each value in "content" has to be a list of dicts with types ("text", "image") 
messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": "What is shown in this image?"},
            {"type": "image", "url": "http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg"},
        ],
    },
]

print("Processing input...")
inputs = processor.apply_chat_template(
    messages, 
    add_generation_prompt=True, 
    tokenize=True, 
    return_dict=True, 
    return_tensors="pt"
)

inputs = {k: v.to("cuda:0") for k, v in inputs.items()}

print("Generating output...")
output = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=250)
print(processor.decode(output[0][2:], skip_special_tokens=True))

```

### Option 2: VLLM inference
#### Install and launch VLLM
```bash
# Install vllm package
pip install vllm==0.6.6.post1

# Launch Robobrain with vllm
python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server --model BAAI/RoboBrain --served-model-name robobrain  --max_model_len 16384 --limit_mm_per_prompt image=8
```

#### Run python script as example:
```python
from openai import OpenAI
import base64

openai_api_key = "robobrain-123123" 
openai_api_base = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1"

client = OpenAI(
    api_key=openai_api_key,
    base_url=openai_api_base,
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="robobrain",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {
                        "url": "http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg"
                    },
                },
                {"type": "text", "text": "What is shown in this image?"},
            ],
        },
